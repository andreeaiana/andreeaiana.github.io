I am a fourth-year PhD student at the [University of Mannheim](https://www.uni-mannheim.de/dws/research/focus-groups/web-data-mining-prof-paulheim/), Germany, advised by Prof. [Heiko Paulheim](https://www.uni-mannheim.de/dws/people/professors/prof-dr-heiko-paulheim/) (University of Mannheim) and Prof. [Goran Glavaš](https://sites.google.com/view/goranglavas) (University of Würzburg). I am interested in exploring algorithmic bias and diversity in (news) recommender systems, as well as in multilingual and knowledge-aware information retrieval. 

Between Dec 2023 and Feb 2024, I was a visting researcher in the [WüNLP Group](https://www.informatik.uni-wuerzburg.de/nlp/) at the [University of Würzburg](https://www.uni-wuerzburg.de/). Previously, I completed my M.Sc. in Business Informatics at the University of Mannheim, where I worked as a research assistant in the Data and Web Science Group.
